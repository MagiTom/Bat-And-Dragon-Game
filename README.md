# Bat-And-Dragon-Game
This is a game which I created inspired by space invaders game. I added a possibility to move within the
frames of the window and shooting in all directions. Enemies are showing up from up side and left side of
the board. I used JavaScript's classes to develop functionality of this game. This is a demo version with
two levels, you have four lives.

## Warning!
Watch out for the UFO and the bat boss. The UFO will change into dragon when you shoot it down and it
will attack you. To kill the bat boss you need to shoot it a couple times.
11) This is second version of my cookies memory games. First version was written in a functional
JavaScript. In this version I focus on object oriented programming.
